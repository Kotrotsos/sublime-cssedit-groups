sublime-cssedit-groups
======================

Sublime Text plugin to make ST users like CSS Edit users a bit more. 

Because i'm somewhat lazy, I didn't go through the process of adding this to the package repository. 
Just create a new folder inside your /packages folder, and copy the file into that folder.

add

    { "keys": ["command+l"], "command": "css_groups" }

..to your user keymap and you will be good to go. Whenever you are inside a CSS file that contains 
CSS edit's Group information (like `/* @group Headings */` ) press command+l and you will be presented with a navigation list to jump around in the CSS file.
